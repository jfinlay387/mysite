[Sorting out Housing](/mysite/download/FinlayWilliams_wpJune2020.pdf) (with Trevor Williams)

Housing expenditure shares decline with income. This causes spatial sorting. Unskilled workers avoid expensive cities because their lower incomes make them more sensitive to high housing costs, while skilled workers have a comparative advantage in living in expensive cities because they are less sensitive to costly housing. We estimate preferences which allow for nonhomothetic housing demand and embed them in a standard quantitative spatial model. We find that the increase in skilled workersâ€™ wages since 1980 relative to those of unskilled workers strengthened the sorting of skilled versus unskilled workers across cities. Our model explains 14% of the increase in city level sorting observed in the US between 1980 and 2010 through the interaction of the rising skill premium with nonhomothetic housing demand.
